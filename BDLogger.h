/**
 * Provides the ability to store and retrieve log entries into a simple log store for later
 * retrieval and analysis.  Key features include:
 *
 *   - Supports logging only entries that have a certain severity or worse
 *   - Keeping only 'n' days worth of logs in order to keep log store size manageable
 *   - Conditionally log using NSLog as well as writing to the log store (allows for easy visibility while debugging in Xcode)
 *   - Quick and easy retrieval of log messages based on date range and severity
 *   - Storage of additional user-specific data per message 
 *
 * All calls to the log: methods run using their own background GCD queue in order to reduce the impact
 * that logging has on the application performance. 
 *
 * A convenience class method called +logger returns an application-wide singleton logger that places 
 * the log store in the user's Caches directory.  The most basic example of how to use the logger is as
 * follows:
 *
 *     BDLogger *logger = [BDLogger logger];
 *     logger.filterSeverity = BDSeverityDebug;
 *     [logger log:BDSeverityInfo message:@"this is a msg"];
 *
 * If you need to store additional information against each log entry, you can create an instance of an
 * BDEntry, and set the userInfo property to a dictionary containing whatever information you like.
 *
 *     BDEntry *entry = [[BDEntry alloc] init];
 *     entry.severity = BDSeverityAlert;
 *     entry.message = @"Some alert";
 *     entry.userInfo = @{ @"somekey" : @"somevalue", @"otherkey" : @(123) };
 *     [logger log:entry];
 *
 * In addition to saving log entries, they can easily be retrieved by calling the -retrieveBetweenStart:end:severity:error:
 * method.  For example:
 * 
 *     BDLogger *logger = [BDLogger logger];
 *     NSError *error = nil;
 *     NSDate *startDate = ...;
 *     NSDate *endDate = ...;
 *     NSArray *entries = [logger retrieveBetweenStart:startDate end:endDate severity:BDSeverityInfo error:&error];
 *
 * While the system offers a singleton logger object, you can still create your own loggers if you want to
 * control where the log store gets written.
 *
 *     NSError *error = nil;
 *     NSString *pathToFile = ...;
 *     BDLogger *logger = [[BDLogger alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:pathToFile]];
 *     [logger open:&error];
 *     [logger log:BDSeverityInfo message:@"this is a msg"];
 * 
 * Pruning the entries out of the log file can be controlled via the pruneLimitDays and pruneFrequencySecs properties.
 * By default, the logger will keep one week's worth of entries in the file and will prune off the trailing records every
 * hour.  
 * @warning Because the settings for pruning are *not* persisted across application launches, if you want to set the 
 * pruneLimitDays to a longer period than a week, you will need make sure that you set it again when the application 
 * relaunches *before* any calls to -log get invoked.  Otherwise, the very first call the the BDLogger code will trigger
 * a prune based on the default period of 7 days.
